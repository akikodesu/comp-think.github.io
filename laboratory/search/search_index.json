Operating systems have different command-line application/interface. Windows uses Command Prompt , Mac uses Terminal , and Linux uses an application called \"Console\" or \"Terminal\" (respectively for the KDE and GNOME environments). Note: In computing, a shell is a user interface for accessing services of an operating system. It can be a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI). It enables a user to perform several operations, such as file management, installations, run processes, monitor and configure OS. We'll use it to install packages and as an interpreter for python. Open the Command Line Interface (CLI) Windows Open the Windows menu Type \"command\" in the search bar Select Command Prompt from the search results macOS Open the Spotlight search box in the upper right-hand corner Type \"terminal\" in the search bar Click on Terminal or just hit return if it's the first result Note: alternatively, go to the directory Applications/Utility and open Terminal application. Linux Open the Dash by clicking the icon of your Linux operating system appearing in the upper-left menu Type \"terminal\" or \"console\" in the search bar Select the Terminal/Console application from the results that appear Check the Python version Type python --version (also python -V on Windows) in the command line, then press return on your keyboard to see whether you have a default version of Python already installed. If you don't have python installed, you should get an error message. macOS usually comes with Python 2.7 already installed, hence the shell will show the current installed version. For instance: python --version Python 2.7.3 Try to type python3 --version (also python3 -V on Windows) in the command line, then press return to check whether you have Python 3 installed, and eventually the last version. Download and install Python Windows Go to the Python download page Click on the download button to get the latest version of Python Double-click on the Python installer just downloaded A dialog box like the one below should appear Click on Customize installation On the following page you should keep all the checkboxes selected, and move to the next page Now you should be in the Advanced Options page. Here you need to keep checked the default options with the addition of these two check-boxes (if not already checked): Install for all users , and Add python to environment varaibles . Make sure the Customize install location has been also updated Click on the Install button, and wait until the end of the installation Finally, go to the command line and try to type python --version (also python3 -V ) and press return to check whether you correctly installed Python. macOS Go to the Python download page Click on the download button to get the latest version of Python Double-click on the downloaded .pkg file to start the installation Follow the step-by-step guidelines Finally, go to the command line and try to type python --version (also python3 --version in case you have also Python 2) and press return to check whether you correctly installed Python Linux Open the Command Line Interface (Terminal or Console) Type sudo apt-get update Type sudo apt-get install python3.10 python3-pip Finally, go to the command line and try to type python --version (also python3 --version in case you have also Python 2) and press return to check whether you correctly installed Python. Note: in case you find troubles in the process, check the following instructions according to your specific Linux distribution Play with Python in the shell Windows, Mac, and Linux users can use the shell as a Python interpreter. The interpreter is the program you\u2019ll need to run Python code and scripts. Technically, the interpreter is a layer of software that works between your program and your computer hardware to get your code running. Type python (or python3 ) in the shell. You'll see in the first line which version of python is installed. If it still shows you python 2.X , type exit() and press enter on your keyboard to exit from python. Try to type python3 to access the latest version of python installed on your computer. In the second line you will see >>> . This means you accessed python in interactive mode and you can now type your commands to be executed by the shell. Try to type print(\"Hello world\") and press enter. >>> print(\"Hello world\") Hello World Type exit() and press enter to exit from the python interactive mode. Install Python libraries A text file containing Python code that is intended to be directly executed by the user is called script . A file that contains Python code that is designed to be imported and used from another Python file, is called module/library . Some libraries/modules (e.g. csv and collections ) are built-ins, meaning you do not need to install them, while others, developed by the larger community, must be downloaded and installed. We can install python libraries using the pip command in the shell. pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. You will use it whenever you want to install a Python library. In case you also have Python 2 installed on your machine, pip is renamed in pip3 . Type pip --version in the shell to see which version is actually installed on your machine. Note (for Windows) : If not installed, follow the instructions here to find where and which version is installed. Install modules with pip3 We will see how to install networkx and anytree . NetworkX : a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. To install networkx type pip3 install networkx in the shell. AnyTree : Simple, lightweight and extensible Tree data structure. To install anytree type pip3 install anytree in the shell. Note: you can also type pip3 install -U <module_name> the -U option will upgrade all packages to the newest available version. Whenever you want to install a library, look for the documentation page and the official name of the package to be used in the shell. Here is the list of libraries/packages you'll need to install for the hands-on classes. beautifulSoup (bs4) fuzzywuzzy requests nltk nltk.data anytree Install Visual Studio Code Windows Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows.

Nowadays we have millions of gigabytes of data generated every day by blogs, social websites, and web pages. A big data analysis using NLP applications can turn out to be very beneficial. Possible NLP applications are speech recognition/translation, semantic analysis of the words, the syntactical/grammatical analysis of the sentences and paragraphs, and others. The analysis of the text is a common and main task in NLP. We will focus on some basic text analysis operations and how are they performed using Python. Note: If you are interested in a further application of NLP methods in python (beyond the materials of this lesson), I suggest you to read the following article: https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/text-mining-in-python-steps-and-examples-78b3f8fd913b The NLTK library The Natural language toolkit (NLTK) is a very popular library for natural language processing in python and it has a large active community behind it.

We will download the popular and essential ones used for working with the basic nltk operations. Write the following line in your python script (after importing nltk): nltk.download(\"popular\") Note: In case running the above commands returns an error message: \"CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED\" , then write in your script only the following lines and run it again. import nltk import ssl try: _create_unverified_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context except AttributeError: pass else: ssl._create_default_https_context = _create_unverified_https_context nltk.download() If you still have some errors please follow these instructions https://www.xspdf.com/help/50406704.html Tokenization and stopwords removal First thing we want to do is a Tokenization and Stopwords removal . Tokenization is the process of separating and classifying different sections of a string. The resulting tokens are then passed on to some other form of processing. For example: If we want to tokenize the sentence \"Hi I am Marco and I am a DHDK student\" Our list of tokens would be: \"Hi\", \"I\", \"am\", \"Marco\", \"and\", \"I\", \"am\", \"a\", \"DHDK\", \"student\" Stopwords removal these are words that may not carry any valuable information, like articles (e.g. \"the\"), conjunctions (e.g. \"and\"), or propositions (e.g. \"with\"). For example: If we want to remove the stop words from the list of tokens \"Hi\", \"I\", \"am\", \"Marco\", \"and\", \"I\", \"am\", \"a\", \"DHDK\", \"student\" Then our new list could be: \"Hi\", \"Marco\", \"DHDK\", \"student\" Toward a text analysis of the Netflix shows dataset (see also the github repository ) Lets see an example in python first from nltk.corpus import stopwords from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize example_sent = \"I want to tokenize and remove all the stopwords from this sentence\" # Tokenize the given sentence word_tokens = word_tokenize(example_sent) # Filter the stopwords stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english')) filtered_sentence = [] for w in word_tokens: if not w in stop_words: filtered_sentence.append(w) print(filtered_sentence a) define a function netflix_titles_tokens() which returns a collection of all the different tokens/words in the Netflix shows titles.
