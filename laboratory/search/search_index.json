Operating systems have different command-line application/interface. Windows uses Command Prompt , Mac uses Terminal , and Linux uses an application called \"Console\" or \"Terminal\" (respectively for the KDE and GNOME environments). Note: In computing, a shell is a user interface for accessing services of an operating system. It can be a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI). It enables a user to perform several operations, such as file management, installations, run processes, monitor and configure OS. We'll use it to install packages and as an interpreter for python. Open the Command Line Interface (CLI) Windows Open the Windows menu Type \"command\" in the search bar Select Command Prompt from the search results macOS Open the Spotlight search box in the upper right-hand corner Type \"terminal\" in the search bar Click on Terminal or just hit return if it's the first result Note: alternatively, go to the directory Applications/Utility and open Terminal application. Linux Open the Dash by clicking the icon of your Linux operating system appearing in the upper-left menu Type \"terminal\" or \"console\" in the search bar Select the Terminal/Console application from the results that appear Check the Python version Type python --version (also python -V on Windows) in the command line, then press return on your keyboard to see whether you have a default version of Python already installed. If you don't have python installed, you should get an error message. macOS usually comes with Python 2.7 already installed, hence the shell will show the current installed version. For instance: python --version Python 2.7.3 Try to type python3 --version (also python3 -V on Windows) in the command line, then press return to check whether you have Python 3 installed, and eventually the last version. Download and install Python Windows Go to the Python download page Click on the download button to get the latest version of Python Double-click on the Python installer just downloaded A dialog box like the one below should appear Click on Customize installation On the following page you should keep all the checkboxes selected, and move to the next page Now you should be in the Advanced Options page. Here you need to keep checked the default options with the addition of these two check-boxes (if not already checked): Install for all users , and Add python to environment varaibles . Make sure the Customize install location has been also updated Click on the Install button, and wait until the end of the installation Finally, go to the command line and try to type python --version (also python3 -V ) and press return to check whether you correctly installed Python. macOS Go to the Python download page Click on the download button to get the latest version of Python Double-click on the downloaded .pkg file to start the installation Follow the step-by-step guidelines Finally, go to the command line and try to type python --version (also python3 --version in case you have also Python 2) and press return to check whether you correctly installed Python Linux Open the Command Line Interface (Terminal or Console) Type sudo apt-get update Type sudo apt-get install python3.10 python3-pip Finally, go to the command line and try to type python --version (also python3 --version in case you have also Python 2) and press return to check whether you correctly installed Python. Note: in case you find troubles in the process, check the following instructions according to your specific Linux distribution Play with Python in the shell Windows, Mac, and Linux users can use the shell as a Python interpreter. The interpreter is the program you\u2019ll need to run Python code and scripts. Technically, the interpreter is a layer of software that works between your program and your computer hardware to get your code running. Type python (or python3 ) in the shell. You'll see in the first line which version of python is installed. If it still shows you python 2.X , type exit() and press enter on your keyboard to exit from python. Try to type python3 to access the latest version of python installed on your computer. In the second line you will see >>> . This means you accessed python in interactive mode and you can now type your commands to be executed by the shell. Try to type print(\"Hello world\") and press enter. >>> print(\"Hello world\") Hello World Type exit() and press enter to exit from the python interactive mode. Install Python libraries A text file containing Python code that is intended to be directly executed by the user is called script . A file that contains Python code that is designed to be imported and used from another Python file, is called module/library . Some libraries/modules (e.g. csv and collections ) are built-ins, meaning you do not need to install them, while others, developed by the larger community, must be downloaded and installed. We can install python libraries using the pip command in the shell. pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. You will use it whenever you want to install a Python library. In case you also have Python 2 installed on your machine, pip is renamed in pip3 . Type pip --version in the shell to see which version is actually installed on your machine. Note (for Windows) : If not installed, follow the instructions here to find where and which version is installed. Install modules with pip3 We will see how to install networkx and anytree . NetworkX : a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. To install networkx type pip3 install networkx in the shell. AnyTree : Simple, lightweight and extensible Tree data structure. To install anytree type pip3 install anytree in the shell. Note: you can also type pip3 install -U <module_name> the -U option will upgrade all packages to the newest available version. Whenever you want to install a library, look for the documentation page and the official name of the package to be used in the shell.

Let's pretend the friends of Harry Potter are: \"Ron\", \"Hermione\", \"Hagrid\", and \"Dumbledore\" . Example: calling the function is_friend_of_harry(\"Malfoy\") returns False . 1.a) Define the function is_friend_of_harry() , and call it for each one of the following characters: \"Hagrid\", \"Voldemort\", and \"Bellatrix\" . Print the result (i.e. True/False ) of each call. Show solution def is_friend_of_harry(p_name): friends_list = [\"Ron\", \"Hermione\", \"Hagrid\", \"Dumbledore\"] if p_name in friends_list: return True else: return False print(is_friend_of_harry(\"Hagrid\")) print(is_friend_of_harry(\"Voldemort\")) print(is_friend_of_harry(\"Bellatrix\")) 1.b) Write a portion of code that prints \"Harry has friends!\" if at least one of the previous characters is a friend of Harry, otherwise, print \"Harry has no friends!\" .

The new function should work the same way even if the given name is not well written, such that it should handle these cases: a) The letters of the name are written in different formats: uppercase and lowercase (e.g. \"ron\", \"RON\", \"Ron\", \"roN\") b) The name includes spaces (e.g. \"Ron \", \" Ron\") c) The name has both (a) and (b) cases combined in it (e.g. \" roN\") Hint: in python {string}.lower() transforms a string to its lowercase form; {string}.strip() removes the starting and ending whitespaces (if any); and {string}.capitalize() capitalizes the first letter of a string Show solution def is_friend_of_harry(p_name): friends_list = [\"Ron\", \"Hermione\", \"Hagrid\", \"Dumbledore\"] p_name = p_name.lower() p_name = p_name.strip() p_name = p_name.capitalize() if p_name in friends_list: return True else: return False 1.d) Define another function is_prof_friend_of_harry() which returns a True value if a given name, which might be written in any format described (1.c), is a professor and a friend of Harry, otherwise the function must return False . The function should call the improved version of the function is_friend_of_harry() in its code (i.e. defined in (1.c)). Let's pretend the professors of Harry Potter are: \"Snape\", \"Lupin\", \"Hagrid\", and \"Dumbledore\" . Show solution def is_prof_friend_of_harry(p_name): prof_list = [\"Snape\", \"Lupin\", \"Hagrid\", \"Dumbledore\"] p_name = p_name.lower() p_name = p_name.strip() p_name = p_name.capitalize() if p_name in prof_list and is_friend_of_harry(p_name): return True else: return False print(is_prof_friend_of_harry(\" hagrid\")) print(is_prof_friend_of_harry(\"voldemort\")) print(is_prof_friend_of_harry(\" Bellatrix \")) 2nd Exercise Each house of Hogwarts has a score which is updated with the addition or subtraction of points based on the behaviour of the houses' members, e.g. after a rule violation. We have two lists: (List-1) the houses of Hogwarts houses = [\"Gryffindor\", \"Hufflepuff\", \"Ravenclaw\", \"Slytherin\"] and (List-2) the score of each house scores = [0,0,0,0] . The score of a house in position N in List-1 is placed in the same position N in List-2 . 2.a) Define the function update_house_score() function which increments/decrements the score of a specific house with a given value of points. The function takes three parameters: house_name , action , and points . The value of action is a string which is either \"+\" (points will be added) or \"-\" (points will be subtracted) Example: Calling the function this way: update_house_score(\"Gryffindor\",\"+\",5) should increment the score of house Gryffindor by 5 points. Hint: The function {list}.index({value}) returns the index of an element in the list, e.g. houses.index(\"Hufflepuff\") returns the value 1 Show solution houses = [\"Gryffindor\", \"Hufflepuff\", \"Ravenclaw\", \"Slytherin\"] scores = [0,0,0,0] def update_house_score(house_name,action,points): index = houses.index(house_name) if action == \"+\": scores[index] += points else: scores[index] -= points 2.b) After the Quidditch cup the Houses have increased/decreased their scores: +10 Gryffindor, +7 Hufflepuff, -3 Slytherin. After the end of the game a member of house \"Slytherin\" helped a man riding his broom, so his house gained back 5 points. Call the function update_house_score() for each action in order to update the houses points and print the two lists: houses and scores . Show solution update_house_score(\"Gryffindor\",\"+\",10) update_house_score(\"Hufflepuff\",\"+\",7) update_house_score(\"Slytherin\",\"-\",3) update_house_score(\"Slytherin\",\"+\",5) print(houses) print(scores) 2.c) redefine update_house_score() using the function eval() ( https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval ) Show solution def update_house_score(house_name, action, points): index = houses.index(house_name) scores[index] = eval(str(points) + action + str(scores[index])) return scores","title":"2.

The value of action is a string which is either \"+\" (points will be added) or \"-\" (points will be subtracted) Example: Calling the function this way: update_house_score(\"Gryffindor\",\"+\",5) should increment the score of house Gryffindor by 5 points. Hint: The function {list}.index({value}) returns the index of an element in the list, e.g. houses.index(\"Hufflepuff\") returns the value 1 Show solution houses = [\"Gryffindor\", \"Hufflepuff\", \"Ravenclaw\", \"Slytherin\"] scores = [0,0,0,0] def update_house_score(house_name,action,points): index = houses.index(house_name) if action == \"+\": scores[index] += points else: scores[index] -= points 2.b) After the Quidditch cup the Houses have increased/decreased their scores: +10 Gryffindor, +7 Hufflepuff, -3 Slytherin. After the end of the game a member of house \"Slytherin\" helped a man riding his broom, so his house gained back 5 points. Call the function update_house_score() for each action in order to update the houses points and print the two lists: houses and scores . Show solution update_house_score(\"Gryffindor\",\"+\",10) update_house_score(\"Hufflepuff\",\"+\",7) update_house_score(\"Slytherin\",\"-\",3) update_house_score(\"Slytherin\",\"+\",5) print(houses) print(scores) 2.c) redefine update_house_score() using the function eval() ( https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval ) Show solution def update_house_score(house_name, action, points): index = houses.index(house_name) scores[index] = eval(str(points) + action + str(scores[index])) return scores","title":"2nd Exercise"},{"location":"chapter/03/","text":"Working with lists and tuples Tuples Similar to lists, but their values can\u2019t be modified numbers = (10,30,50,70) print(numbers[2]) #ERROR: assignment is not allowed numbers[2] = 55 Loops: \"while\" and \"for\" Loops are used in order to repeat similar actions We can't loop forever this will make our program crash Our loops need a rule/condition that defines when they need to stop The \"while\" statement a = 0 while a < 10 : print(a) a += 1 The \"for\" statement Repeat the inner code for a number of times We use it when we already know how many times/repetitions we need to execute our code In python a for loop is done its execution when it finishes iterating a given sequence for a in range(0,10): print(a) Exercises 1st Exercise Let's pretend we have a list containing the titles of all the Computational Thinking lessons.

The number of pokemons participating in the tournament is 8. Each pokemon is defined using 3 values: (1)name, (2)attack-points, and (3) defense-points. A pokemon could be therefore characterized using a tuple of 3 elements, e.g. (\"Poliwag\",10,5) . The tournament could be defined as a list of 8 pokemons (i.e. tuple). For instance: pokemon_tournament = [(\"Poliwag\",10,5),(\"Charmander\",15,2),(\"Abra\",8,7),(\"Pidgey\",4,5),(\"Goldeen\",6,8),(\"Bulbasaur\",12,10),(\"Charmeleon\",18,8),(\"Psyduck\",3,4)] To determine the champion of the tournament 2 nearby pokemons (according to their order in the list) compete. The pokemon on the left uses the attack-points (second value of the tuple), while the right one uses the defense-points (third value of the tuple), if the attack-points are higher than the defense-points then the pokemon on the left side goes up to the next round, otherwise, the pokemon on the right side does that. The same process will be repeated in the second round too. The tournament ends when we have 1 final winner. For example the winner of the tournament pokemon_tournament is: # ROUND 1: (\"Poliwag\",10,5)vs(\"Charmander\",15,2) | (\"Abra\",8,7)vs(\"Pidgey\",4,5) | (\"Goldeen\",6,8)vs(\"Bulbasaur\",12,10) | (\"Charmeleon\",18,8)vs(\"Psyduck\",3,4) # ROUND 2: (\"Poliwag\",10,5)vs(\"Abra\",8,7) | (\"Bulbasaur\",12,10)vs(\"Charmeleon\",18,8) # THE FINAL: (\"Poliwag\",10,5)vs(\"Bulbasaur\",12,10) # THE WINNER: (\"Bulbasaur\",12,10) Define a recursive function called pokemon_champion() which takes a tournament (i.e. a list of pokemons) and returns the updated tournament list containing only the champion of the tournament.

Nowadays we have millions of gigabytes of data generated every day by blogs, social websites, and web pages. A big data analysis using NLP applications can turn out to be very beneficial. Possible NLP applications are speech recognition/translation, semantic analysis of the words, the syntactical/grammatical analysis of the sentences and paragraphs, and others. The analysis of the text is a common and main task in NLP. We will focus on some basic text analysis operations and how are they performed using Python. Note: If you are interested in a further application of NLP methods in python (beyond the materials of this lesson), I suggest you to read the following article: https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/text-mining-in-python-steps-and-examples-78b3f8fd913b The NLTK library The Natural language toolkit (NLTK) is a very popular library for natural language processing in python and it has a large active community behind it.

Tokenization is the process of separating and classifying different sections of a string. The resulting tokens are then passed on to some other form of processing. For example: If we want to tokenize the sentence \"Hi I am Marco and I am a DHDK student\" Our list of tokens would be: \"Hi\", \"I\", \"am\", \"Marco\", \"and\", \"I\", \"am\", \"a\", \"DHDK\", \"student\" Stopwords removal these are words that may not carry any valuable information, like articles (e.g. \"the\"), conjunctions (e.g. \"and\"), or propositions (e.g. \"with\"). For example: If we want to remove the stop words from the list of tokens \"Hi\", \"I\", \"am\", \"Marco\", \"and\", \"I\", \"am\", \"a\", \"DHDK\", \"student\" Then our new list could be: \"Hi\", \"Marco\", \"DHDK\", \"student\" Toward a text analysis of the Netflix shows dataset (see also the github repository ) Lets see an example in python first from nltk.corpus import stopwords from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize example_sent = \"I want to tokenize and remove all the stopwords from this sentence\" # Tokenize the given sentence word_tokens = word_tokenize(example_sent) # Filter the stopwords stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english')) filtered_sentence = [] for w in word_tokens: if not w in stop_words: filtered_sentence.append(w) print(filtered_sentence a) define a function netflix_titles_tokens() which returns a collection of all the different tokens/words in the Netflix shows titles.

Hint: Importing from nltk.probability import FreqDist and using FreqDist({LIST_OF_TOKENS}) returns a dictionary, such that the dictionary key is a token and its value is the number of times it appears in the given list. To print the results you can use {FREQ_DIST_DICT}.most_common({N}) , this function prints the {N} most frequent terms inside the dictionary {FREQ_DIST_DICT}.

Nowadays we have millions of gigabytes of data generated every day by blogs, social websites, and web pages. A big data analysis using NLP applications can turn out to be very beneficial. Possible NLP applications are speech recognition/translation, semantic analysis of the words, the syntactical/grammatical analysis of the sentences and paragraphs, and others. The analysis of the text is a common and main task in NLP. We will focus on some basic text analysis operations and how are they performed using Python. Note: If you are interested in a further application of NLP methods in python (beyond the materials of this lesson), I suggest you to read the following article: https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/text-mining-in-python-steps-and-examples-78b3f8fd913b","title":"Text analysis"},{"location":"chapter/7_lesson/#the-nltk-library","text":"The Natural language toolkit (NLTK) is a very popular library for natural language processing in python and it has a large active community behind it.

We will download the popular and essential ones used for working with the basic nltk operations. Write the following line in your python script (after importing nltk): nltk.download(\"popular\") Note: In case running the above commands returns an error message: \"CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED\" , then write in your script only the following lines and run it again. import nltk import ssl try: _create_unverified_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context except AttributeError: pass else: ssl._create_default_https_context = _create_unverified_https_context nltk.download() If you still have some errors please follow these instructions https://www.xspdf.com/help/50406704.html","title":"The NLTK library"},{"location":"chapter/7_lesson/#tokenization-and-stopwords-removal","text":"First thing we want to do is a Tokenization and Stopwords removal .
