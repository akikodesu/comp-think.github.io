# Working with lists and tuples

## Tuples
Similar to lists, but their values canâ€™t be modified

```{.python .code-overflow-wrap}
numbers = (10,30,50,70)
print(numbers[2])

#ERROR: assignment is not allowed
numbers[2] = 55
```

## Loops: "while" and "for"

* Loops are used in order to repeat similar actions
* We can't loop forever this will make our program crash
* Our loops need a rule/condition that defines when they need to stop

### The "while" statement

```{.python .code-overflow-wrap}
a = 0
while a < 10 :
    print(a)
    a += 1
```

### The "for" statement

* Repeat the inner code for a number of times
* We use it when we already know how many times/repetitions we need to execute our code
* In python a for loop is done its execution when it finishes iterating a given sequence

```{.python .code-overflow-wrap}
for a in range(0,10):
    print(a)
```

## Exercises

### 1st Exercise
Let's pretend we have a list containing the titles of all the Computational Thinking lessons. The list is ordered following the established schedule. Below is the list:
```{.python .code-overflow-wrap}
l_schedule = ["Introduction to the course","Introduction to Computational Thinking","Algorithms","Laboratory","Computability","Programming languages","Organising information: ordered structures","Laboratory","Brute-force algorithms","Laboratory","Organising information: unordered structures","Laboratory","Recursion","Laboratory","Divide and conquer algorithms","Laboratory","Dynamic programming algorithms","Organising information: trees","Backtracking algorithms","Organising information: graphs","Greedy algorithms"]
```

**1.a)** Define a function named <code class="py">lab_lessons()</code> which takes <code class="py">l_schedule</code> as a parameter and returns the total number of <code class="py">"Laboratory"</code> lessons.

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_3_1a')">Show solution</button>
```{.python .code-overflow-wrap .solution-code #sol_3_1a}
def lab_lessons(a_list):
    count = 0
    for title in a_list:
        if title == "Laboratory":
            count += 1
    return count
```

**1.b)** Define a function named <code class="py">all_before_lab()</code> which takes <code class="py">l_schedule</code> as a parameter and returns a list containing all the lessons scheduled before the first <code class="py">"Laboratory"</code> lesson.

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_3_1b')">Show solution</button>
```{.python .code-overflow-wrap .solution-code #sol_3_1b}

def all_before_lab(a_list):
  result = []
  i = 0
  title = a_list[i]
  while title != "Laboratory":
    result.append(title)
    i += 1
    title = a_list[i]
  return result
```

**1.c)** Let's pretend we have a new list representing an extended version of the <code class="py">l_schedule</code>, such that it embeds information about the date, time and the duration (in hours) of the each lesson. We call the new list <code class="py">l_schedule_extended</code>. Each element is represented as a tuple: <code class="py">([HOURS],[DATE],[TIME],[TITLE])</code>. For instance, the third lesson "Algorithms" will have the corresponding tuple: <code class="py">(2,"15/10/21","12:30-14:30","Algorithms")</code>. Here we have the entire <code class="py">l_schedule_extended</code>:

```{.python .code-overflow-wrap}
l_schedule_extended = [(2,"11/10/21","09:30-11:30","Introduction to the course"),(2,"13/10/21","09:30-11:30","Introduction to Computational Thinking"),(2,"15/10/21","12:30-14:30","Algorithms"),(2,"18/10/21","09:30-11:30","Laboratory"),(2,"20/10/21","09:30-11:30","Computability"),(2,"22/10/21","12:30-14:30","Programming languages"),(2,"25/10/21","09:30-11:30","Organising information: ordered structures"),(2,"27/10/21","09:30-11:30","Laboratory"),(2,"29/10/21","12:30-14:30","Brute-force algorithms"),(2,"08/11/21","09:30-11:30","Laboratory"),(2,"10/11/21","09:30-11:30","Organising information: unordered structures"),(2,"15/11/21","09:30-11:30","Laboratory"),(2,"17/11/21","09:30-11:30","Recursion"),(2,"22/11/21","09:30-11:30","Laboratory"),(2,"24/11/21","09:30-11:30","Divide and conquer algorithms"),(2,"29/11/21","09:30-11:30","Laboratory"),(2,"01/12/21","09:30-11:30","Dynamic programming algorithms"),(2,"06/12/21","09:30-11:30","Organising information: trees"),(2,"13/12/21","09:30-11:30","Backtracking algorithms"),(2,"15/12/21","09:30-11:30","Organising information: graphs"),(2,"20/12/21","09:30-11:30","Greedy algorithms")]
```

Define a function <code class="py">max_lessons_hours()</code> which takes <code class="py">l_schedule_extended</code> and a number <code class="py">max_hours</code> as parameters, and returns a list containing only the titles of all the lessons which could be attended with a maximum number of hours = <code class="py">max_hours</code>, starting from the first lesson of the year.

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_3_1c')">Show solution</button>
```{.python .code-overflow-wrap .solution-code #sol_3_1c}
def max_lessons_hours(a_list, max_hours):
    result = []
    tot_hours = 0
    i = 0
    while tot_hours < max_hours:
        title = a_list[i][3]
        result.append(title)
        tot_hours += a_list[i][0]
        i += 1
    return result
```

**1.d)** One of the students attending the course, Tim Berners Lee, thinks he knows enough about the materials taught in the course, so he will take a break and go for a vacation on 12/11/21 for 2 weeks. Right after that, when he gets back he will attend again the lectures starting from the first available one according to the schedule until the end of the course. Write down a portion of code that prints the titles of the lectures that Tim Berners Lee will attend at the end of the course.  
**Hint:** take a look at the `datetime` library

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_3_1d')">Show solution</button>
```{.python .code-overflow-wrap .solution-code #sol_3_1d}
vacation_date = datetime.datetime.strptime("12/11/21", '%d/%m/%y')
back_date = vacation_date + datetime.timedelta(weeks=2)

result = []
i = 0
for lesson_tuple in l_schedule_extended:
    lesson_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(lesson_tuple[1], '%d/%m/%y')
    if lesson_date < vacation_date or lesson_date > back_date:
        result.append(lesson_tuple[3])

print(result)
```
