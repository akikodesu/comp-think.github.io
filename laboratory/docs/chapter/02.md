# Programming in Python - the basics

## Syntax in Python

### Variables

**Some general considerations**

* In Python, a variable is created when you first assign a value to it
```py
planet = 'Jupiter'
```

* The name of a variable cannot start with a digit or contain a special symbol (e.g., `|Â£$%@#`)
* Some keywords cannot be used for naming variables.

```py
False | class | finally | is | return | None | continue | for | lambda | try | True | def
from | nonlocal | while | and | del | global | not | with | as | elif | if | or
yield | assert | else | import | pass | break | except | in | raise
```
* Python is case-sensitive: `planet` and `Planet` are different variables

**Naming conventions**

The following naming styles are commonly distinguished:

* snake case: lower_case_with_underscores
* CamelCase: CapitalizedWords
* mixedCase: differs from CamelCase by initial lowercase character

**Python naming convention**

The <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#naming-conventions" target="_blank" alt="pep-8 and Python naming conventions">Python Enhancement Proposal number 8 (PEP 8)</a> states:
<div class="note">
Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.  Variable names follow the same convention as function names.
</div>

Use names that make sense: `planet = 'Jupiter'` rather than `p = 'Jupiter'`


### Punctuation and indentation

You don't need to add punctuation at the end of lines
```py
planet = 'Jupiter'
position_from_sun = 5
```

Use semicolons in case you want to put multiple statements in a single line
```py
planet = 'Jupiter' ; position_from_sun = 5
```

Document your code using comments
```py
# this is the first comment
planet = 'Jupiter'  # and this is the second comment
          # ... and now a third!
text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
```

### Data types

#### Numbers

```py
# Integers
known_satellites = 80

# Floating point numbers
hydrogen_percentage = 0.89
```

The `int()` and `float()` methods convert booleans, numbers and number-like strings to integers and floating point numbers

```py
known_satellites = int('80')
# 80
the_world_is_flat = float(True)
# 1.0
the_world_is_flat = float(False)
# 0.0
```

#### Strings

```py
planet = 'Jupiter' # This is a string
```

The `str()` method returns the string representation of a given object

```py
known_satellites = str(80)
# Use the type() function to return the type of the object
print(type(known_satellites))
# <class 'str'>
```

#### Lists

```py
# You can initialise an empty list with the list() method
planets = list()
# Or using square brackets
planets = []
# To fill the list, you can put the items separated by commas between square brackets
planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus']

# In Python you count from zero
print(planets[4]) # Jupiter

# To sort the list
planets_sorted_alphabetically = sorted(planets)
# planets = ['Earth', 'Jupiter', 'Mars', 'Mercury', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Venus']

# Add a new item to the list
planets.append('Neptune')
# planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']

# Count how many elements we have in a list
planets_count = len(planets) # 8
```   

### String interpolation

*String interpolation* is the process of substituting values of variables into placeholders in a string

```py
print("The fifth planet is %s" %(planets[4]))

print("The fifth planet is {}".format(planets[4]))

print(f"The fifth planet is {planets[4]}")

# The fifth planet is Jupiter
```

## Operators
#### Arithmetic operators

```py
x = 5
y = 2

# + Add two operands
print(x + y) # 7

# - Subtract the right operand from the left one
print(x - y) # 3

# * Multiply two operands
print(x * y) # 10

# / Divide the left operand by the right one. Division always returns a floating point number
print(x / y) # 2.5

# ** Raise the left operand to the power of the right one
print(x ** y) # 25

# % Return the remainder of the division. It is called modulus
print(x % y) # 1

# // Discard the fractional part of the division's result. It is called floor division
print(x // y) # 2
```

#### Comparison operators

```py
x = 5
y = 2

# > Greater than - True if the left operand is greater than the right one
print(x > y) # True

# < Less than - True if the left operand is less than the right one
print(x < y) # False

# == Equal to - True if both operands are equal
print(x == y) # False

# != Not equal to - True if operands are not equal
print(x != y) # True

# >= Greater than or equal to - True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right one
print(x >= y) # True

# <= Less than or equal to - True if the left operand is less than or equal to the right one
print(x <= y) # False
```

<div class="note">
<strong>Note the difference</strong>: <code>=</code> is an assignment operator, used to assign a value to a variable. Conversely, <code>==</code> is a Boolean operator that checks whether the right operand is equal to the left one
</div>

#### Logic operators

```py
x = True
y = False

# "and": True if both the operands are true
print(x and y) # False

# "or": True if at least one of the operands is true
print(x or y) # True

# "not": True if the operand is False and viceversa
print(not x) # False
```

#### Assignment operators

```py
# with "="
x = 5
print(x)

# with "+="
x += 5 # A shortcut for x = x + 5
print(x)

# with "-="
x -= 2 # A shortcut for x = x - 2
print(x)

# Try with other arithmetic operands ...
```

#### Membership operators

```py
planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus']

# "in": True if value/variable is found in the sequence
print('Pluto' in planets) # False

# "not in": True if value/variable is not found in the sequence
print('Moon' not in planets) # True
```

## Conditional statement

A decision might be taken only when a specific condition is satisfied

```py
the_world_is_flat = True
if the_world_is_flat:
  print("Be careful not to fall off!")
```

Use indentation to separate **code blocks** by pressing the <img src="../img/tab_key.png" height="50"> key. 

A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit, i.e., a conditional statement or a function body

## Functions
A block of code which defines a specific algorithm and runs only when it is called

```py
# def {func_name}({parameter_1}, {parameter_2}, ...):
  # {func_body}
def add(num1, num2):
	return num1 + num2

my_sum = add(5,4)
print(my_sum) # 9
```

## Exercises

### 1st Exercise
The function `is_friend_of_harry()` returns a *True* value if a given name (i.e. type string) is one of the friends of Harry Potter, otherwise the function returns *False*. Let's pretend the friends of Harry Potter are: *"Ron", "Hermione", "Hagrid",* and *"Dumbledore"*.   

**Example:** calling the function `is_friend_of_harry("Malfoy")` returns *False*.

<span class="ex-part"> **1.a)** Define the function `is_friend_of_harry()`, and call it for each one of the following characters: *"Hagrid", "Voldemort",* and *"Bellatrix"*. Print the result (i.e. *True/False*) of each call. </span>

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_1')">Show solution</button>
<div class="solution-code" id="sol_1">
```py
def is_friend_of_harry(name):
  friends_list = ["Ron", "Hermione", "Hagrid", "Dumbledore"]
  if name in friends_list:
    return True
  else:
    return False
print(is_friend_of_harry("Hagrid"))
print(is_friend_of_harry("Voldemort"))
print(is_friend_of_harry("Bellatrix"))
```
</div>

<span class="ex-part"> **1.b)** Write a portion of code that prints *"Harry has friends!"* if at least one of the previous characters is a friend of Harry, otherwise, print *"Harry has no friends!"*. </span>

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_2')">Show solution</button>
<div class="solution-code" id="sol_2">
```py
is_hagrid_friend = is_friend_of_harry("Hagrid")
is_voldemort_friend = is_friend_of_harry("Voldemort")
is_bellatrix_friend = is_friend_of_harry("Bellatrix")
if is_hagrid_friend or is_voldemort_friend or is_bellatrix_friend:
    print("Harry has friends!")
else:
    print("Harry has no friends!!")
```
</div>

<span class="ex-part"> **1.c)** Let's make our function `is_friend_of_harry()` a bit more powerful. The new function should work the same way even if the given name is not well written, such that it should handle these cases:

* a) The letters of the name are written in different formats: uppercase and lowercase (e.g. "ron", "RON", "Ron", "roN")
* b) The name includes spaces (e.g. "Ron  ", " Ron")
* c) The name has both (a) and (b) cases combined in it (e.g. "   roN")

**Hint:** in python `{string}.lower()` transforms a string to its lowercase form; `{string}.strip()` removes the starting and ending whitespaces (if any); and `{string}.capitalize()` capitalizes the first letter of a string </span>

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_3')">Show solution</button>
<div class="solution-code" id="sol_3">
```py
def is_friend_of_harry(name):
  friends_list = ["Ron", "Hermione", "Hagrid", "Dumbledore"]
  name = name.lower()
  name = name.strip()
  name = name.capitalize()
	if name in friends_list:
    	return True
    else:
    	return False
```
</div>

<span class="ex-part"> **1.d)** Define another function `is_prof_friend_of_harry()` which returns a *True* value if a given name, which might be written in any format described (1.c), is a professor and a friend of Harry, otherwise the function must return *False*. The function should call the improved version of the function `is_friend_of_harry()` in its code (i.e. defined in (1.c)). Let's pretend the professors of Harry Potter are: *"Snape", "Umbridge", and "Hagrid"*.</span>

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_4')">Show solution</button>
<div class="solution-code" id="sol_4">
```py
def is_prof_friend_of_harry(name):
  prof_list = ["Snape", "Umbridge", "Hagrid"]

  name = name.strip()
  name = name.capitalize()
  if name in prof_list and is_friend_of_harry(name):
    return True
  else:
    return False
print(is_prof_friend_of_harry("snape"))
print(is_prof_friend_of_harry(" umbridge  "))
print(is_prof_friend_of_harry("  hagrid"))
```

### 2nd Exercise
Each house of Hogwarts has a score which is updated with the addition or subtraction of points based on the behaviour of the houses' members, e.g. after a rule violation. We have two lists: 

* the houses of Hogwarts <code class="py">houses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]</code>
* the score of each house <code class="py">scores = [0,0,0,0]</code>. The score of a house in position *n* in `houses` is placed in the same position *n* in `scores`.

**2.a)** Define the function `update_house_score()` which increments/decrements the score of a specific house with a given value of points. The function takes three parameters: `house_name`, `action`, and `points`. The value of `action` is a string which is either *"+"*(points will be added) or *"-"* (points will be subtracted)  
**Example:** Calling the function this way: <code class="py">update_house_score("Gryffindor", "+", 5)</code> should increment the score of house Gryffindor by 5 points.  
**Hint:** The function <code class="py">{list}.index({value})</code> returns the index of an element in the list, e.g. <code class="py">houses.index("Hufflepuff")</code> returns the value *1*

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_5')">Show solution</button>
<div class="solution-code" id="sol_5">
```py
houses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]
scores = [0,0,0,0]
def update_house_score(house_name, action, points):
  house_index = houses.index(house_name)
  if action == "+":
    scores[house_index] += points
  else:
    scores[house_index] -= points
```
</div>

**2.b)** After the Quidditch cup the Houses have increased/decreased their scores: +10 Gryffindor, +7 Hufflepuff, -3 Slytherin. After the end of the game a member of house "Slytherin" helped a man riding his broom, so his house gained back 5 points. Call the function `update_house_score()` for each action in order to update the houses points and print the two lists: `houses` and `scores`.

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_6')">Show solution</button>
<div class="solution-code" id="sol_6">
```py
update_house_score("Gryffindor", "+", 10)
update_house_score("Hufflepuff", "+", 7)
update_house_score("Slytherin", "-", 3)
update_house_score("Slytherin", "+", 5)
print(houses)
print(scores)
```
</div>

**2.c)** redefine `update_house_score()` using the function `eval()` ([https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval))

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_2_2c')">Show solution</button>
<div class="solution-code" id="sol_2_2c">
```py
def update_house_score(house_name, action, points):
    house_index = houses.index(house_name)
    scores[house_index] = eval(str(points) + action + str(scores[house_index]))
    return scores
```
</div>
