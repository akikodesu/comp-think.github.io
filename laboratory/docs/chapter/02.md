# Programming in Python - the basics

## Syntax in Python

### Variables

**Some general considerations:**

* Python does not require you to define the type of the variables, just declare them:
```py
a = 2
```

* The name of a variable can not start with a digit or contain a special symbol (|Â£$%@# etc.)
* Some keywords cannot be used for naming variables.

```py
False | class | finally | is | return | None | continue | for | lambda | try | True | def
from | nonlocal | while | and | del | global | not | with | as | elif | if | or
yield | assert | else | import | pass | break | except | in | raise
```
* Python is case sensitive:
```py
variable != Variable
```

**Some good practises for naming a variable:**

* Combine lowercase letters (a-z) uppercase letters (A-Z), digits (1-9) and underscore (_)
* Use camelCase(`thisIsMyVariable`) or underscore to separate words (`this_is_my_variable`)
* Use names that make sense `count = 10` rather than `c = 10`


### Punctuation and indentation

You don't need to add punctuation at the end of lines
```py
a = 2
b = 2
```

Use semicolons in case you want to put multiple statements in a single line
```py
a = 2 ; b = 3
```

Use indentation to separate code blocks (is recommended to use tabs)
```py
a = 2
if a > 2:
  print(a)
```

Document your code using comments
```py
# a comment to describe the variable assignment
a = 2
# a comment to describe the if condition
if a > 2:
  print(a)
```

### Data types

#### Numbers

```py
# Integers
a = int(5)

# Floating point numbers
a = float(5.0)

# Complex numbers
a = complex(5+2j)
```

#### Strings

```py
s = "This is a string"
s = str(25)
```    

#### Lists

```py
# This is a list
myList = ['three', 'two', 'one']

# To print the value 'two'
print(myList[1])

# To sort the list
myList = sorted(myList)
# Now myList = ['one', 'three', 'two']

# Add a new item to the list
myList.append('star')
# Now myList = ['one', 'three', 'two', 'star']

# Count how many elements we have in a list
myList_length = len(myList)
# the value of myList_length is 4
```   

### The Print command

```py
x = 5
print(x)

print("The value of x is ",x)
print("The value of x is "+str(x))

y = 2
print("The value of x is {} and the value of y is {}".format(str(x),str(y)))
```

## Operators
#### Arithmetic operators

```py
x = 5
y = 2

# + Add two operands or unary plus
print(x+y)

# - Subtract right operand from the left or unary minus
print(x-y)

# * Multiply two operands
print(x*y)

# / Divide left operand by the right one (always results into float)
print(x/y)

# % Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right (remainder of x/y)
print(x%y)

# // Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line
print(x//y)

# ** Exponent - left operand raised to the power of right (x to the power y)
print(x**y)
```

#### Comparison operators

```py
x = 5
y = 2

# > Greater than - True if left operand is greater than the right
print(x > y)

# < Less than - True if left operand is less than the right
print(x < y)

# == Equal to - True if both operands are equal
print(x == y)

# != Not equal to - True if operands are not equal
print(x != y)

# >= Greater than or equal to - True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right
print(x >= y)

# <= Less than or equal to - True if left operand is less than or equal to the right
print(x <= y)
```

#### Logic operators

```py
x = True
y = False

# "and": True if both the operands are true
print(x and y)

# "or": True if either of the operands is true x or y
print(x or y)

# "not": True if operand is false (complements the operand)
print(not x)
```

#### Assignment operators

```py
# with "="
x = 5
print(x)

# with "+="
x += 5
print(x)

# with "-="
x -= 2
print(x)

# Try with other arithmetic operands ...
```

#### Membership operators

```py
my_list = [5,2,4,2]
x = 4

# "in": True if value/variable is found in the sequence
print(x in my_list)

# "not in": True if value/variable is not found in the sequence
print(x not in my_list)
```

## Conditional statement

A decision might be taken only when a specific condition is satisfied

```py
num = 3
if num >= 0:
	print("Positive or Zero")
else:
	print("Negative number")
```

## Functions
A block of code which defines a specific algorithm and runs only when it is called.

```py
# def {func_name}({parameter_1}, {parameter_2}, ...)
def add(num1, num2):
	return num1 + num2

my_sum = add(5,4)
print(my_sum)
```


## Exercises

### 1st Exercise
The function `is_friend_of_harry()` returns a *True* value if a given name (i.e. type string) is one of the friends of Harry Potter, otherwise the function returns *False*. Let's pretend the friends of Harry Potter are: *"Ron", "Hermione", "Hagrid",* and *"Dumbledore"*.   

**Example:** calling the function `is_friend_of_harry("Malfoy")` returns *False*.

<span class="ex-part"> **1.a)** Define the function `is_friend_of_harry()`, and call it for each one of the following characters: *"Hagrid", "Voldemort",* and *"Bellatrix"*. Print the result (i.e. *True/False*) of each call. </span>

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_1')">Show solution</button>
<div class="solution-code" id="sol_1">
```py
def is_friend_of_harry(p_name):
  friends_list = ["Ron", "Hermione", "Hagrid", "Dumbledore"]
  if p_name in friends_list:
    return True
  else:
    return False
print(is_friend_of_harry("Hagrid"))
print(is_friend_of_harry("Voldemort"))
print(is_friend_of_harry("Bellatrix"))
```
</div>

<span class="ex-part"> **1.b)** Write a portion of code that prints *"Harry has friends!"* if at least one of the previous characters is a friend of Harry, otherwise, print *"Harry has no friends!"*. </span>

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_2')">Show solution</button>
<div class="solution-code" id="sol_2">
```py
a = is_friend_of_harry("Hagrid")
b = is_friend_of_harry("Voldemort")
c = is_friend_of_harry("Bellatrix")
if a or b or c:
    print("Harry has friends!")
else:
    print("Harry has no friends!!")
```
</div>

<span class="ex-part"> **1.c)** Let's make our function `is_friend_of_harry()` a bit more powerful. The new function should work the same way even if the given name is not well written, such that it should handle these cases:

* a) The letters of the name are written in different formats: uppercase and lowercase (e.g. "ron", "RON", "Ron", "roN")
* b) The name includes spaces (e.g. "Ron  ", " Ron")
* c) The name has both (a) and (b) cases combined in it (e.g. "   roN")

**Hint:** in python `{string}.lower()` transforms a string to its lowercase form; `{string}.strip()` removes the starting and ending whitespaces (if any); and `{string}.capitalize()` capitalizes the first letter of a string </span>

    p_name = p_name.capitalize()
	if p_name in friends_list:
    	return True
    else:
    	return False
```
</div>

<span class="ex-part"> **1.d)** Define another function `is_prof_friend_of_harry()` which returns a *True* value if a given name, which might be written in any format described (1.c), is a professor and a friend of Harry, otherwise the function must return *False*. The function should call the improved version of the function `is_friend_of_harry()` in its code (i.e. defined in (1.c)). Let's pretend the professors of Harry Potter are: *"Snape", "Lupin", "Hagrid",* and *"Dumbledore"*.  </span>

  p_name = p_name.capitalize()
  if p_name in prof_list and is_friend_of_harry(p_name):
    return True
  else:
    return False
print(is_prof_friend_of_harry("  hagrid"))
print(is_prof_friend_of_harry("voldemort"))
print(is_prof_friend_of_harry(" Bellatrix  "))
```

### 2nd Exercise
Each house of Hogwarts has a score which is updated with the addition or subtraction of points based on the behaviour of the houses' members, e.g. after a rule violation. We have two lists: (List-1) the houses of Hogwarts <code class="py">houses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]</code> and (List-2) the score of each house <code class="py">scores = [0,0,0,0]</code>. The score of a house in position *N* in *List-1* is placed in the same position *N* in *List-2*.

**2.a)** Define the function `update_house_score()` function which increments/decrements the score of a specific house with a given value of points. The function takes three parameters: `house_name`, `action`, and `points`. The value of `action` is a string which is either *"+"*(points will be added) or *"-"*(points will be subtracted)  
**Example:** Calling the function this way: <code class="py">update_house_score("Gryffindor","+",5)</code> should increment the score of house Gryffindor by 5 points.  
**Hint:** The function <code class="py">{list}.index({value})</code> returns the index of an element in the list, e.g. <code class="py">houses.index("Hufflepuff")</code> returns the value *1*

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_5')">Show solution</button>
<div class="solution-code" id="sol_5">
```py
houses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]
scores = [0,0,0,0]
def update_house_score(house_name,action,points):
    index = houses.index(house_name)
	if action == "+":
    	scores[index] += points
    else:
    	scores[index] -= points
```
</div>

**2.b)** After the Quidditch cup the Houses have increased/decreased their scores: +10 Gryffindor, +7 Hufflepuff, -3 Slytherin. After the end of the game a member of house "Slytherin" helped a man riding his broom, so his house gained back 5 points. Call the function `update_house_score()` for each action in order to update the houses points and print the two lists: `houses` and `scores`.

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_6')">Show solution</button>
<div class="solution-code" id="sol_6">
```py
update_house_score("Gryffindor","+",10)
update_house_score("Hufflepuff","+",7)
update_house_score("Slytherin","-",3)
update_house_score("Slytherin","+",5)
print(houses)
print(scores)
```
</div>

**2.c)** redefine `update_house_score()` using the function `eval()` ([https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval))

<button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_2_2c')">Show solution</button>
<div class="solution-code" id="sol_2_2c">
```py
def update_house_score(house_name, action, points):
    index = houses.index(house_name)
    scores[index] = eval(str(points) + action + str(scores[index]))
    return scores
```
</div>
