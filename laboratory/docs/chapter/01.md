# Getting started with Python

## Check if Python is already installed
We will use a command-line interpreter &ndash; i.e., the **shell** &ndash; to check if you already have the last version of Python installed on your machine (Windows, Mac, or Linux). Operating systems have different command-line applications/interfaces. Windows uses [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell), Mac uses [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_\(macOS\)), and Linux uses an application called [Konsole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konsole) or [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal) (respectively for the [KDE Plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE_Plasma_5) and [GNOME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME) desktop environments).

<span class="note">
In computing, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)">shell</a> is a user interface for accessing the services of an operating system. It can be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command-line interface (CLI)</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">graphical user interface (GUI)</a>. It enables a user to perform several operations, such as file management, installations, running processes, monitoring and configuring an OS. We will use it to install packages and as an interpreter for Python.
</span>


### Open the Command Line Interface (CLI)

#### Windows
* Open the Windows menu
* Type *"powershell"* in the search bar
* Select **Windows PowerShell** from the search results

#### macOS
* Open the Spotlight search box in the upper right-hand corner
* Type *"terminal"* in the search bar
* Click on **Terminal** or just hit return if it is the first result

<span class="note">Alternatively, go to the directory <span class="dir">Applications/Utility</span> and open **Terminal** application.</span>

#### Linux (Ubuntu)
* Open the applications drawer
* Type *"terminal"* or *"konsole"* in the search bar
* Select the **Terminal/Konsole** application from the results that appear

<span class="note">
Alternatively, you can press the combination Ctrl+Alt+T to open the terminal rapidly
</span>

### Check the Python version
Type `python --version` (also `python -V` on Windows) in the command line, then press return on your keyboard to see whether you have a default version of Python already installed. You should get no message or an error message if you do not have Python installed. macOS usually comes with Python 2.7 already installed; hence the shell will show the currently installed version. For instance:  
~~~~
python --version
Python 2.7.3
~~~~

Try to type `python3 --version` (also `python3 -V` on Windows) in the command line, then press return to check whether you have Python 3 installed, and eventually the last version.

## Download and install Python

#### Windows
* Go to the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Click on the download button to get the latest version of **Python**
* Double-click on the Python installer just downloaded
* A dialog box like the one below should appear  

<img src="../img/py_installer_windows.png">  

* Click on *Customize installation*
* On the following page you should keep all the checkboxes selected, and move to the next page
* Now you should be in the Advanced Options page. Here you need to keep checked the default options with the addition of these two check-boxes (if not already checked): <b>Install for all users</b>, and **Add python to environment varaibles**. Make sure the *Customize install location* has been also updated  

<img src="../img/py_installer_options.png">  

* Click on the **Install** button, and wait until the end of the installation
* Finally, go to the command line and try to type <code>python --version</code> (also <code>python3 -V</code>) and press return to check whether you correctly installed Python.


#### macOS
* Go to the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Click on the download button to get the latest version of **Python**
* Double-click on the downloaded .pkg file to start the installation
* Follow the step-by-step guidelines
* Finally, go to the command line and try to type <code>python --version</code> (also <code>python3 --version</code> in case you have also Python 2) and press return to check whether you correctly installed Python

#### Linux (Ubuntu)
* Open the Command Line Interface (Terminal or Console)
* Type <code>sudo apt-get update</code>
* Type <code>sudo apt-get install python3.10 python3-pip</code>
* Finally, go to the command line and try to type <code>python --version</code> (also <code>python3 --version</code> in case you have also Python 2) and press return to check whether you correctly installed Python.  

<span class="note">**Note:** in case you find troubles in the process, check the <a href="https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-on-ubuntu-and-linux-mint">following instructions</a> according to your specific Linux distribution<span>

### Play with Python in the shell
Windows, Mac, and Linux users can use the shell as a Python interpreter.

The interpreter is the program you will need to run Python code and scripts. Technically, the interpreter is a layer of software that works between your program and your computer hardware to get your code running.

* Type `python` (or `python3`) in the shell. You will see in the first line which version of python is installed. If it still shows you `python 2.X`, type `exit()` and press enter on your keyboard to exit from python. Try to type `python3` to access the latest version of python installed on your computer.
<span class="note">As a **rule of thumb**, on Windows type <code>python</code>, on macOS and Linux type <code>python3</code>. From now on we will always use <code>python3</code> for convenience</span>
* In the second line, you will see `>>>`. It means you accessed python in *interactive mode* and can now type your commands to be executed by the shell.
* Try to type `print("Hello world")` and press enter.

~~~
>>> print("Hello world")
Hello World
~~~

* Type `exit()` and press enter to exit from the python interactive mode.

## Install Python libraries

A text file containing Python code intended to be directly executed by the user is called a <b>script</b>. A file containing Python code designed to be imported and used from another Python file is called a <b>module/library</b>.

Some libraries/modules (e.g. `csv` and `collections`) are built-ins, meaning you do not need to install them, while others, developed by the larger community, must be downloaded and installed.

We can install python libraries using the `pip` command in the shell. <code>pip</code> is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. You will use it whenever you want to install a Python library. In case you also have Python 2 installed on your machine, pip is renamed in <code>pip3</code>.

<span class="note">As a **rule of thumb**, on Windows use <code>pip</code>, on macOS and Linux use <code>pip3</code>. From now on we will always use <code>pip3</code> for convenience</span>

Type `pip --version` in the shell to see which version is actually installed on your machine.  
<span class="note">**Note (for Windows)**: If not installed, follow the [instructions here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41501636/how-to-install-pip3-on-windows/41501815) to find where and which version is installed.</span>


### Install modules with pip3
We will see how to install [networkx](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/) and [anytree](https://pypi.org/project/anytree/).

* **NetworkX**: a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. To install `networkx` type `pip3 install networkx` in the shell.
* **AnyTree**: Simple, lightweight and extensible Tree data structure. To install `anytree` type `pip3 install anytree` in the shell.

<span class="note">**Note:** you can also type `pip3 install -U <module_name>` the `-U` option will upgrade all packages to the latest version.</span>

Whenever you want to install a library, look for the documentation page and the official name of the package to be used in the shell. Here is the list of libraries/packages you will need to install for the hands-on classes.

 * [beautifulSoup (bs4)](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
 * [fuzzywuzzy](https://pypi.org/project/fuzzywuzzy/)
 * [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
 * [nltk](https://pypi.org/project/nltk/)
 * [nltk.data](https://www.nltk.org/data.html)
 <span class="note">Run <code>python3 -m nltk.downloader all</code> to download all corpora</span>
 * [anytree](https://pypi.org/project/anytree/)

## Install the editor: Visual Studio Code

Programming using the shell interpreter is convenient for small tests but impractical for developing complex applications. For this reason, special editors, called [integrated development environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDE), are used. For Python, the most widely used IDEs are Visual Studio Code, PyCharm and Atom. We suggest using Visual Studio Code for this course.

#### Windows
* Download the [Visual Studio Code installer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs?dv=win) for Windows.
* Run the downloaded installer (VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe). This will only take a minute
* By default, VS Code is installed under <span class="dir">C:\users\{username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code</span>  

<span class="note">**Note:** .NET Framework 4.5.2 or higher is required for VS Code. If you are using Windows 7, make sure you have at least [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42643) installed. You can check your version of .NET Framework using this command, `reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\full" /v version` from a command prompt.</span>

<span class="note">**Note:** you can find more details at [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows)</span>

#### macOS
* Download [Visual Studio Code](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534106) for macOS.
* Open the browser's download list and locate the downloaded archive.
* Extract the contents of the downloaded archive. (usually with a double-click)
* Drag **Visual Studio Code.app** to the Applications folder, making it available in the macOS Launchpad.

<span class="note">**Note:** you can find more details at [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)</span>

#### Linux
For Debian/Ubuntu based distributions, download and install the [.deb package (64-bit)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=760868), either through the graphical software center if it's available, or through the command line with: `sudo apt install ./<file>.deb`

<span class="note">**Note:** you can find more details and guidelines for other linux distributions at [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)</span>

## Create and run a Python script in Visual Studio Code


### Install Python extension for Visual Studio Code
* Open Visual Studio Code
* Install the [Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) from the Visual Studio Marketplace. The Python extension is named **Python** and it's published by Microsoft. To open the extensions marketplace click on this icon:

<span class="note">**Note:** you can find more details at [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)</span>

### Create and run the first Python script
* Select <span class="dir">File -> New File </span>
* Select <span class="dir">Text File</span>
* You need to select the type of the file (i.e. the programming language) and save it. Click on **select a language**, search for *"python"* and select it.
<img src="../img/vsc_select_lang.png">

* Now we can write our first script. Write the following code:

<!-- <button class="toggle-solution btn btn-light" onclick="toggle_click(this,'sol_1')">Show solution</button>s
```{.python .code-overflow-wrap .solution-code #sol_1}-->
```py
print("Hello World !!")
```

* Run the script by clicking on the menu arrow near the run button and selecting **Run Python File in Terminal**  
<img src="../img/vsc_run.png">

<span class="note">**Note:** by default Visual Studio Code should detect the Python interpreter automatically
